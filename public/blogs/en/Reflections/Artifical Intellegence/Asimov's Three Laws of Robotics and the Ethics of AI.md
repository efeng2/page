# Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics and the Ethics of AI
2025-03-11

**First Law**
A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 

**Second Law**
A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 

**Third Law**
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. 


## Reflection
Though Asimov's laws are only used in his science fiction stories, where robots have gained "conscience", the concepts that he proposed are worth thinking about in the modern AI era. Considering the current way that AI is being used today, we can see that there are ethical concerns to how these AI tools are being used. For example, scammers might use AI deepfakes to spread misinformation or scam people out of money by stealing another peron's identity, which harms another human being. We have to be aware and careful of how AI tools could be used maliciously when we develop them and create policies that could combat it.

**Potiental Policy that Might Help Combat This**
Since scammers use similar language (such as pretending to be another person when asking for money), AI systems could be trained to recognize these patterns and refuse to serve because of the first law, it would harm other people. AI service generated products should have a watermark too so people would know that it is AI generated. If scammers use their own created AI generation tools, video calling apps and video platforms should be trained to recognize AI videos and voice and give a potential warning sign. They would greatly increase people's caution when dealing with AI.

I am optimistic about the use of AI being regulated to be beneficial to humanity. First, technological advances always brought more ways for people to exploit them and bring harm to society, such as the internet and hackers and scammers. Despite that, the internet has benefited humanity and regulated. There will always be people that try to exploit these things, but I believe that we are able to regulate it to fight against them.
